# Analysis-of-Pizza-Place-Restaurant-Performance-in-2015
This project aims to analyze the performance of the Pizza Place restaurant in the year 2015 using their historical data. 
The analysis encompasses several crucial aspects, including monthly order counts, peak hours, the most popular pizza types, revenue contribution from each pizza size, and revenue contribution from each pizza type. The primary objective of this project is to provide in-depth insights to the management of Pizza Place Restaurant to make better-informed decisions in managing their business.

Activities Conducted:

Analysis of Monthly Order Counts (Line Chart): Data from order_id for each year-month is processed and visualized in the form of a line chart. The results indicate which month had the highest order count.

Identification of Peak Hours (Bar Plot): Data from order_details is used to create a dataset of peak hours based on order times. These peak hours are then visualized in the form of a bar plot to identify the busiest hours.

Analysis of the Most Popular Pizza Types (Bar Plot): Data from order_details is combined with pizza data to calculate the total quantity of each pizza type ordered. The results are visualized in a bar plot with a descending order to identify the most commonly ordered pizza types.

Analysis of Revenue Contribution from Each Pizza Size (Pie Chart): Revenue for each pizza size is calculated using the formula revenue = quantity x price. The results are visualized in a pie chart to show the percentage contribution of each pizza size.

Analysis of Revenue Contribution from Each Pizza Type (Bar Plot): Revenue for each pizza type is calculated using the formula revenue = quantity x price. The results are visualized in a bar plot, sorted from highest to lowest revenue.
